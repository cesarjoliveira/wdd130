        <p> I'm a Brazilian happy guy. I love music and having time with my family. 
            I Borned at Brazilian Northeast in a small city named "Bezerros" but as soon as I turn 6 months old
            my family moved to Sao Paulo and I lived there until I turn 18. Then I served a mission for 
            The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints at Manaus Brazil.
            I feel blessed for serving a mission.
            Curently I work as a data engineer. 
            As a data engineer I work a lot of business and personal data, 
            designing and implementing efficient data pipelines. Despite my professional focus, 
            my heart remains tied to Brazil, where I was born and spent my formative years. 
            Serving a mission in Manaus was a transformative experience, and now as a data engineer, 
            I find joy in balancing work and family.
            In the midst of crafting data symphonies as a data engineer, I still sway to the vibrant tunes 
            of my Brazilian origins. Serving a mission in Manaus not only broadened my horizons but also 
            added unique notes to the rhythm of my life, where work and family compose a harmonious melody.

        <p>

            Espirito Santo, in Brazil, is an incredible state in the Southeast region. Picture stunning beaches meeting
            lush mountainsâ€”a true blend of natural beauty. Moreover, we have a rich cultural tradition with folk
            festivals that tell our story in a unique way. Our capital, VitÃ³ria, is lively by the seaside, while Vila
            Velha boasts rock formations that are a marvel. Oh, and I can't forget about the coffee! We produce
            high-quality coffee that's part of our contribution to the Brazilian economy. It's a place where nature,
            culture, and progress come together.
